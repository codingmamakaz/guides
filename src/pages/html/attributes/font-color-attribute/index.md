#### The HTML Font Element `<font>` defines the font size, color and face for its content.
# * Obsolete
# This feature is obsolete. Although it may still work in some browsers, its use is discouraged since it could be removed at any time. Try to avoid using it.
## Do not use this element! Though once normalized in HTML 3.2, it was deprecated in HTML 4.01, at the same time as all elements related to styling only, then obsoleted in HTML5.
## Starting with HTML 4, HTML does not convey styling information anymore. For any new web development, styling should be written using CSS only.
## The former behavior of the `<font>` element can be achieved, and even better controlled using the CSS Fonts CSS properties.
